# Evidence command and v1 contract

`gradoom-evidence` is the installed, public entry point for GraDOOM parity and training evidence.
The first complete workflow is `parity_readiness`. It can exercise the evidence seam with fixture
inputs before the real WAD profile, reference provider, and pretrained policy corpus are available.
It reports those prerequisites as unavailable; it does not issue a parity certificate or make a
performance claim.

Run the repository fixture with:

```bash
gradoom-evidence \
  --manifest tests/fixtures/evidence/readiness-manifest.json \
  --output readiness-report.json
```

The command exits with status 2 and a concise error when the manifest is malformed, its schema
version is unsupported, a declared file does not match its SHA-256 digest, or a merge report is
incompatible. It writes the report only after all validation succeeds.

## Manifest schema version 1

The v1 readiness manifest is a JSON object with these fields:

- `schema_version`: the integer `1`.
- `workflow`: `parity_readiness`.
- `evidence_level`: `development`. Development evidence is always non-authoritative.
- `fixture`: whether fixture inputs are in use. Fixture evidence is never claim-eligible.
- `code_provenance`: `repository`, `revision`, and boolean `dirty` state declared by the operator.
- `declared_inputs`: uniquely named files, each with a path and lowercase SHA-256 digest. Relative
  paths are resolved from the manifest directory and are verified before report creation.
- `prerequisites`: uniquely identified readiness prerequisites with an `available` boolean. Every
  unavailable prerequisite must include a human-readable `reason`.
- `wad_profile` (required when `certified_freedoom2_wad_profile` is declared available): the
  `freedoom2-deathmatch-v1` profile ID and exactly one `gradoom` and one `env-vizdoom-turbo`
  provider binding. Each binding declares `iwad_path`, `pwad_path`, and the complete policy-facing
  `configuration`. Relative WAD paths are resolved from the manifest directory.

The repository fixture is the executable example of this schema:
[`tests/fixtures/evidence/readiness-manifest.json`](../tests/fixtures/evidence/readiness-manifest.json).

## First WAD profile

The immutable `freedoom2-deathmatch-v1` manifest binds:

- Freedoom2 IWAD SHA-256
  `a8772e088847032510d97ba2312406a6998f21cbab44d4ff10696faa9c0ecd4b` and ViZDoom deathmatch
  PWAD SHA-256 `1d06c2113f2c1546062635ad599f49cd852287a08b7b07b26d30b8f4c362a42d`;
- `MAP01`, Doom skill 1, player mode, 320x240 source resolution, first-tic episode start,
  player-death termination, disabled HUD and screen flashes, and a 4200-tic truncation horizon;
- the custom discrete 17-action table, identified by SHA-256
  `0bd9dd28d67a88ef6bc54734f53d55bc4af597e672665a7f20d4b204098036af`, with frame skip 2; and
- a zero-filled bottom-32 mask, 84x84 area resize, the pinned RGB/area/GRAY8 conversion, CHW
  layout, and four-frame stacking.

The bundled JSON is a packaged representation, not its own authority. The evidence implementation
independently pins canonical profile SHA-256
`a3953ddfd4de7c8a99f51fed58dfbdc7002f6bf1c561ebbd25819aedf6e0cde7` and strictly checks every
key, type, and fixed value against the approved profile. A missing, undecodable, malformed,
incomplete, or semantically changed resource fails readiness before provider assets are inspected,
records `wad_profile_authority_failure`, and emits no profile or binding identity.

The command hashes all four provider asset paths before provider or training work. A missing or
incorrect asset, unequal provider bytes, or any configuration difference produces `status:
failed`, structured `wad_profile.failures`, and a `wad_profile_mismatch` claim reason in the
readiness report. Exact matches record the complete profile, both normalized provider bindings,
the bundled profile-manifest hash, and stable profile/binding identities. Asset paths are not
identity fields; their verified bytes and every policy-facing setting are.

These checks apply only to formal evidence. `GraDoomVecEnv` continues to accept compatible
operator-supplied Doom II and Freedoom IWADs for ordinary deathmatch use, where
`parity_certified` remains false and no WAD-profile evidence is inherited.

## Report schema version 1

The JSON report records its schema version, workflow, evidence level, fixture state, readiness
status, claim eligibility and structured reasons, stable run identity, declared code provenance,
declared inputs, prerequisites, optional WAD-profile validation, and evidence index. A fixture
report is `unavailable` while real
prerequisites are missing, has `claim_eligible: false`, and names every missing prerequisite in
`claim_reasons`.

`run_identity` is the lowercase SHA-256 digest of canonical JSON containing the manifest schema,
workflow, evidence level, fixture state, code provenance, input names and declared hashes,
prerequisite identifiers, and—when supplied—the complete normalized WAD-profile binding. Input and
prerequisite ordering does not affect it. Canonical JSON uses
UTF-8, sorted object keys, no insignificant whitespace, and JSON separators `,` and `:`. File paths
are not identity fields; the declared content hashes are.

The `evidence_index.entries` array contains the raw manifest-file digest, every verified declared
input digest, and, when used, the bundled WAD-profile manifest plus every readable provider WAD
digest. `evidence_index.sha256` hashes the canonical JSON representation of that complete entries
array using the same rules. This makes index mutation detectable without attempting the impossible
operation of including the report's own digest inside itself.

## Safe continuation

Pass `--merge EXISTING_REPORT.json` when continuing evidence collection. The command validates the
existing report schema, recomputes its run identity from its recorded identity-bearing fields,
validates its evidence-index hash, then requires the recomputed identity to equal the run described
by the new manifest. Unlike code provenance, evidence levels, declared input hashes, or prerequisite
sets fail instead of being combined.
